By default, the old Office 2010 KMS Host License Pack is not compliant with Windows Server 2016.
Here is the Office 2010 KMS Host License Pack patched for Windows Server 2016 :)

Simple how to :
Copy the sources under c:\Program Files (x86) on your KMS server
Run a cmd.exe as admin then run cscript.exe with kms_host.vbs file
Enter your KMS key when prompted then activate the key online or offline (by phone) using classic process
